<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>

If you're here, that means you probably been redirected here by a trinket given to you at a con!
Here you can see all of the different trinkets made and handed out, by whom and their companions, STL information, and what con they're from!

<p>Total trinkets made and record so far: {{ site.cosplay_trinkets | size }}</p>

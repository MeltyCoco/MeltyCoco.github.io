<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>

If you're here, that means you probably been redirected here by a trinket given to you at a con!
Here you can see all of the different trinkets made and handed out, by whom and their companions, STL information, and what con they're from!

If you're interested in getting a trinket for your next cosplay, or if you want a 3d printed prop from me (trinkets are bonus to print commission!), feel free to reach out to me on discord: MeltyCoco

<p>Total trinkets made and recorded so far: {{ site.cosplay_trinkets | size }}</p>

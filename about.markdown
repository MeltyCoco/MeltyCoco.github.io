# Hi I'm MeltyCoco!  

I'm a software engineer that has way too much free time to spend on his own hobby. I love 3d printing and cosplaying at conventions, so why not combine them both!  

So now I hand out 3d printed trinkets that relates to my favorite fandom or the cosplay I'm wearing! The only requirement you need to get a trinket is to come up and say hi! Or if you have a booth, I'll usually buy an item and then during payment, hand you a trinket matching the series!  

No trinkets uses any AI during the creation of them at all! _**SUPPORT THE ARTISTS**_
